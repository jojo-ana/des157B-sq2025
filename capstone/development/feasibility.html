    <p> The two main features I want to have is one, a drag and drop based minigame and two, motion graphic esque micro animations for visual appeal. To make the minigame, I plan to jQuery User Interface, specifically the Draggable Interaction with styled Dialog to make an interactive overlay to convey information. For the planned micro animation, especially for the title text, I plan to use GSAP. I also want to use Scroll on Animate just to include another element of visual noise. While the micro animations are very much doable, the drag and drop will be new to me. That being said, I feel like it will be definitely doable using “checkings” in JS paired with classes. Everything else is just changing the displayed content based on "how far" the user is and switching between scenes, but that can be easily done using counters and classes for display.
