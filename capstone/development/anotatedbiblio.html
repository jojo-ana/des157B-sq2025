    This article is a critique of the myth of the American Dream and how it highlights how rising inequality, policy failure, and overreliance on credit have eroded social mobility and economic fairness in the US. It provides critical insight into the troubling direction society is heading shaped and furthered by policy neglect and inequality. Some informative visuals and data are being used to reinforce the key points–points include economic theory, real-world examples, and global comparisons. Alberto Gallo is a macro credit expert and a former senior researcher at Goldman Sachs, RBS, and Algebris Investments and is commenting from a historical and financial/capitalistic perspective. It gives warnings that without major reforms (including wealth distribution, education investment, and tax restructuring) democracy and economic stability are at risk, and how policy is systemically made.

    This article is an analysis of how class dynamics actively shape and sustain the narrative of the American dream, often using it as a tool to uphold existing social hierarchies and justify economic inequality. It offers insight from a class-based perspective that many people can relate to, especially those wanting respite in this troubling world. Additionally, it gives perception  into how the ideal of “living well” is often framed around individual success/advancement, rather than collective well-being, otherwise known as “the American Greed.” Sarah Churchwell is a professor of American Literature at the School of Advanced Study, University of London.  Originally, the concept of the American Dream centered on equality and collective well-being, not wealth accumulation. The ideal has been distorted to justify individual success and economic inequality. Because it societally shifted, it reflects how class dynamics and growing inequality have reshaped national values, making it harder for people to recognize or reclaim the Dream’s original intent

    The academic paper not only acknowledges the difficultly in putting a specific definition on the American Dream, but also how the narrative evolved. While it does well in framing the origins of the “American Dream” and how its idealization is realized, there is even a section on how it can actually be realized, embracing themes of freedom, democracy, and american exceptionalism. The acceptance and prevalence of a national ideal that holds within it so many different and conflicting dreams. It draws from original historical literature, offering a unique and authentic perspective grounded in primary sources. This is a thesis submitted for Donna Knudsen’s Master of Liberal Arts from the University of South Florida St. Petersburg. Despite its contradictions and exclusions, the American Dream continues to persist as a shared national ideal—primarily because of how it’s framed and communicated. The rhetorical patterns found in presidential inaugurals reflect broader cultural and political shifts, including changes in the role of the President, national identity, and public expectations. Because the concept of the American Dream is less a reflection of shared reality and this rhetorical strategy helps maintain belief by downplaying societal conflicts and presenting an idealized version of the nation. Thus, makes it less about accurcy and more so political and culturally useful.
