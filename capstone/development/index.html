        <h1>DES 157B - Capstone Development</h1>
    </header>

    <p>The overarching topic I want to cover is how the perception of wanting to achieve the American Dream is a contributing factor to ruining what it means to have and be part of a community. The target audience is young adults aged 22 to 28, otherwise, individuals potentially navigating a pivotal transition period in their lives. Broadly speaking, this topic will touch on how a system that promised stability instead left many disillusioned, overworked, and under-supported. That being said, I want to challenge the mental models associated with this perception, including the strive for social mobility and the individualistic nature of people.

    <p>Some features I imagine including is an interactive narrative presentation style, potentially using the libraries to make some “minigames” (potentially having the user put the story together in parts)—libraries include drag-and-drop and scroll to animate. Because the project will be more information-based, I also want to include some data visualization to hone in on the importance of having a community. With that in mind, I am on the fence if I want to approach this project more game-like or more UI/UX focused and what that might entail for the final product of the project.
