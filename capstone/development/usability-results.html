    <ol>
        <li>Users appreciated information being embedded within the puzzle rather than only before or after</li>        
    </ol>
    <p>Several participants mentioned that encountering information <i>during</i> the puzzle made the experience more engaging and helped break up content naturally. This confirms that integrating educational moments within gameplay supports retention and pacing. To enhance this, I’ll refine how text and puzzle interactions overlap. For example, gating certain puzzle elements until content has been acknowledged.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>The “future” section needs a stronger visual identity and thematic focus.</li>        
    </ol>
    <p>While users understood the past and present sections, the future section felt vague. Suggestions ranged from tech-corporate aesthetics to space-age Jetsons or late-stage capitalism themes. A suggested visual aesthetic to follow could make use of transparency, minimalism, and robotics to evoke feelings of a speculative future.</p>

    <p>Planned Updates Based on Feedback:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Integrate informational moments more tightly into the puzzle structure, with clearer feedback and pacing cues particularly when content is being revealed/encourage user flow</li>
        <li>Enhance visual and audio interactivity, especially in the puzzle phase, by adding feedback sounds, hover animations, and subtle motion.</li>
        <li>Redesign the future section to reflect a distinctive aesthetic direction (cybernetic, transparent, space-inspired), using participant suggestions as stylistic anchors.</li>
        <li>Improve onboarding with visual indicators to make it clearer this is a game-based interaction</li>
    </ul>
